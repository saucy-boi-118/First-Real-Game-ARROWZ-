# First-Real-Game-ARROWZ-
A simple game made in C# raylib


# What is this Project

This is a lightweight raylib C# project of a simple game I was working on. Since I built this without a game engine and only a graphics framework it took a longer time then expected.

# Why I built this

Raylib is a severly underated framework for making games in my opinion and everytime I try and look for resources it isn't that easy so I decide to build a few core game examples like guided missles or in this case arrows.
